# Data Structures and Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project was developed as part of the coursework for the Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) subject. Its primary objective was to deepen my understanding of how to effectively use data structures in practical applications. The project focuses on implementing a custom stack to solve the problem of prime factorization, allowing me to apply theoretical concepts in a hands-on manner.

Additionally, the project includes plans for expanding to a second problem, providing further opportunities to explore and apply data structure concepts.

## Features
- Custom stack implementation for solving problems
- Prime factorization of a number
- Display prime factors
- Display prime factors in exponential form

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bogdannp90/DSA-Project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd DSA-Project
    ```
3. Open the project in CLion or your preferred IDE.

## Usage
1. Build the project using your IDE.
2. Run the `main` function to access the main menu.
3. Choose an option from the menu to execute the corresponding functionality.

Example:

    Input: 120
    Output: The prime factorization of 120 is: 5 * 3 * 2 * 2 * 2
            The prime factorization of 120 in exponential form is: 5^1 * 3^1 * 2^3


## File Structure
The following structure represents all the key files in the project:

- `include/`
  - `myStack.h`: Header file for the `myStack` class.
  - `handleProblem1.h`: Header file for handling the prime factorization problem.
  - `inputValidation.h`: Header file for input validation functions.
- `src/`
  - `myStack.cpp`: Implementation of the `myStack` class.
  - `handleProblem1.cpp`: Implementation of the prime factorization problem.
- `main.cpp`: Entry point of the program, handles the main menu and user interactions.
